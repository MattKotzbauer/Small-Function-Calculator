This (work in progress) program uses top-down enumerative synthesis of f(x)-form functions to find matches to input and output examples. Due to the exponential nature of this problem, this program will have both a limited syntax of functions it traverses through (addition, multiplication, etc.) and a limited size of constants it checks for within the existing function forms.
